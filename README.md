</div>
<br/>

A syndication feed bot for [Stoat](https://stoat.chat) that supports RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. The bot automatically fetches feeds and posts new items.

## Features

- [x] Support for RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds
- [x] Automatic feed checking
- [x] Manual forced feed checking
- [x] Duplicate detection to prevent spam

## Documentation and Support

All of AutoFeed's commands and features are documented in the help command, triggered by `@AutoFeeds help`, and on [the AutoMod website](https://automod.vale.rocks/docs/autofeeds). If you still have questions or need help, you can join the [support server on Stoat](https://stt.gg/automod). The Stoat server is also a good way to stay in the loop on updates, changes, and development.

## Invite to Your Server

If you're on the official Stoat instance at [stoat.chat](https://stoat.chat) then you can [add AutoFeeds to your server](https://stoat.chat/bot/01HZNFJK4C23AJE95JWY0JXB18). If you're on a third-party instance, then [you'll need to host it yourself](https://automod.vale.rocks/docs/autofeeds/self-hosting).
