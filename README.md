Feed bot for Revolt
</div>
<br/>

A syndication feed bot for [Revolt](https://revolt.chat) that supports RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds. The bot automatically fetches feeds and posts new items.

## Features

[X] Support for RSS, Atom, and JSON feeds
[X] Automatic feed checking
[X] Manual forced feed checking
[X] Duplicate detection to prevent spam

## Documentation and Support

All of AutoFeed's commands and features are documented in the help command, triggered by `@AutoFeeds help`. If you still have questions or need help, you can join the [support server on Revolt](https://rvlt.gg/automod). The Revolt server is also a good way to stay in the loop on updates, changes, and development.

## Invite to Your Server

If you're on the official Revolt instance at [revolt.chat](https://revolt.chat) then you can [add AutoFeeds to your server](). If you're on a third-party instance, then you'll need to host it yourself. Instructions to do so are available in [SELF-HOSTING.md].
